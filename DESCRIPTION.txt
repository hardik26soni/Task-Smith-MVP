Welcome to TaskSmith 👋  

This project is an early MVP (minimum viable product) of our idea — a platform that helps students and young professionals connect with clients looking for affordable, reliable freelance work.  

We are not here to compete with giant freelancing marketplaces. Instead, our goal is simple:  
- Give students a chance to showcase their skills.  
- Help clients discover fresh talent for their projects.  
- Build a bridge between ambition and opportunity.  

At this stage, what you see is only a working prototype. It doesn’t handle real payments, and it doesn’t store live project data yet. It’s just a way to test how the platform might look and feel.  

If you’re reading this, we’d love for you to know that this is a passion project in progress. We’re learning, improving, and open to feedback. Every bit of support — whether that’s sharing ideas, pointing out issues, or just exploring the repo — means a lot.  

Thanks for checking us out 🙏
